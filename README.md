## Nina's ATM (Bear Robotics coding project)

Welcome to a mini ATM project. To use the ATM, follow these steps:

1. Enter in your pin. If it is the first time in the current session that you are entering your pin, you can choose any pin you want, and a balance will be created for you. Be sure to remember what your pin is!
2. Choose whether you would like to deposit or withdraw money into your account. If depositing, enter the amount you would like to deposit into the input box labeled "Deposit amount". If withdrawing, enter the amount you would like to withdraw into the input box labeled "Withdrawal amount". Click enter when finished, and your balance will update accordingly.
3. Repeat step 2 until you are finished with the current session and click "Done with session".
4. If you would like to make further changes, input your pin again without refreshing the page.
